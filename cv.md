## Code example:
Given a random non-negative number, you have to return the digits of this number within an array in reverse order.
```
function getConvertArr(num) {
  num = String(num);
  let arrNumStr = num.split('');
  let newArrNum = [];
  if (num < 0) {
    return 'Please, type positive number';
  }
  for (let i = 0; i < arrNumStr.length; i++) {
    newArrNum[i] = arrNumStr[arrNumStr.length - i - 1];
    newArrNum[i] = Number(newArrNum[i]);
  }
  return newArrNum;
