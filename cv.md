## About me:

My length of work is about one year now. In future I want to learn some information about Backend part of the software devepolpent to understand the whole proccess of creating the web application.

I improve my skills every day, learn some new information about JS, Git and IT in general. I read articles connected with IT and listen to some podcasts on YouTube. Also I try to practice every day too.

I am hard-working, fast-learner and repsonsible person and I love to learn something new.
